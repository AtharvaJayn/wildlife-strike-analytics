# ðŸ›« Wildlife-Aircraft Strike Data Analytics Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a **data analytics and visualization tool** designed to analyze airplaneâ€“wildlife strike incidents involving **military, commercial, and civil aircraft**. The aim is to identify patterns, assess risks, and derive insights to mitigate such incidents.

The dataset is sourced from the **Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Wildlife Strike Database** and provides a comprehensive overview of incidents including aircraft details, wildlife species, locations, and damage severity.

A fully interactive **Power BI dashboard** has been created to present these insights in a clear and actionable way.
